Created repository in GitHub `Workshop-storage-system`

Installed Git on PC

Cloned repository to its own folder on my PC
    	
- guide:
  - 1) open the folder where the repository will be stored on your own PC
  - 2) right click in the folder and choose `open in terminal`
  - 3) get the repository clone link from GitHub, green button with `<>code`  
  	in this case: https://github.com/Damlien/Verksted-Lager-system.git
  - 4) in the terminal write `git clone [url]`  
  	in this case: `git clone https://github.com/Damlien/Workshop-storage-system.git`
  - 5) results in a new folder with the same name as the repository `Workshop-storage-system`

Added extra folders in `workshop-storage-system` on my PC: 
- `learning_experiments` for projects used to learn code
- `src` for source code

Created the text file `DEV_LOG.md` for logging

GitHub must now be updated with changes on the PC. 

- three commands are used:    	

  - `git add .`  
    - the command tells git which changes have been made and what should be included in the next
    - update. In the command, the dot indicates all changes made in the project folder.
  
  - `git commit -m "message"`  
    - for documentation. Locks changes and gives a unique ID number. `-m` stands for message.     			
    - explain what has been done in the message enclosed by `" "`.

  - `git push`  
    - sends all changes and the documentation to GitHub.

In the `learning_experiments` folder, the folder `Data_inventory_test` was created.  
- Testing of JSON for storing data with Python.  
- Created the script `Data_inventory_test.py`. 

	code that was used:

		import json

		list of dictionaries for storing data for components in inventory:
			ex:
				components = [
					{"id": 1, "name": "resistor 10kΩ", "quantity": 100, "shelf": 1},
					{"id": 2, "name": "Arduino Nano",  "quantity": 8,   "shelf": 2},
					{"id": 3, "name": "capacitor",     "quantity": 20,  "shelf": 3}
				]

		with open(filename, mode):

			the purpose of `with` is automatic handling of the file. The file is open for the indented block below. 
			After the block, the file is closed. 

		json.dump(variable, file_object)

		json.load(file_object)

`learning_experiments` – script `Data_inventory_test.py` update  
- made changes in the script `Data_inventory_test.py` inside the folder `Data_inventory_test`  
  - now uses the `Path` class from `pathlib` for modern and tidy handling of file paths. 

	code:

		from pathlib import Path

		BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent 
			first part `Path(__file__)` fetches the path to the Python script, 
			`.resolve()` finds the exact, absolute path to the file or folder.
			`.parent` finds the folder the file is in.
			the result is then the full path to the folder the file is in.
		
		FILE_PATH = BASE_DIR / "inventory.json"
			here you get the path to the actual file.

Created the folder `search` and the file `search_inventory.py`.  
- The script makes it possible to search for components in the file `inventory.json`.  
- Uses simple input for a search word and uses it to compare with names in the inventory list. 

- Uses the `pathlib` library to find the location of `inventory.json`, which lies in a different folder than the script. 

Created the folder `inventory_change` and the scripts: `restock_item.py`, `item_registration.py` and `item_withdrawal.py`.

- `restock_item.py`: look up an item and add to the quantity. 
- `item_withdrawal.py`: look up an item and reduce the quantity.
- `item_registration.py`: add a completely new component. 


Restructuring of the project ("Refactoring")  
- Realized that having separate files for each action (`item_withdrawal.py`, `restock_item.py`) became messy and led to a lot of duplicated code.
- Created the folder `src_learning` to collect the code in a more structured way.
- Split the code into two main parts (modularization):
  - `inventory_service.py`: a "backend" file that contains all the functions (logic) for talking to the "database" (`get_inventory`, `save_inventory`, `search_item`, `new_item`, `change_stock`, `update_item`). This file has no `input()` or `print()`, it only handles data.
  - `my_app.py`: a "frontend" file (CLI / simple UI) that controls the menu and communicates with the user. This imports the functions from `inventory_service.py`. 

Prototyping of GUI (Graphical User Interface)  
- Wanted to explore the possibilities for a visual program rather than a text-based terminal.  
- Created `my_app.py` in `src_learning` as a Tkinter-based GUI that uses `inventory_service.py`.
- **Note:** Parts of this file are generated with the help of AI to demonstrate the potential of the `tkinter` library.
  - **Purpose:** To have a working prototype ("Gold Standard") to navigate by.
  - **Learning point:** Discovered that GUI programming requires a different mindset ("event-driven") than the linear scripts written earlier. The program waits for events (clicks) instead of running from top to bottom.
- The program works and uses the same logic from `inventory_service.py`, but the code is currently too complex to be used as direct learning material. 

Plan going forward:  
- Use `inventory_service.py` as the foundation for further development.  
- Create small, isolated GUI scripts (e.g. `my_gui_start.py`) to learn `tkinter` from scratch, step-by-step, instead of copying large, generated code blocks.

New function in `inventory_service.py` `send_discord_alerts(product_name, quantity)`

- Purpose: send message to discord text channel informing about low number of components in inventory
- Need "import requests" (might need to install it through terminal before use)
- In "discord -> text channel -> text channel settings -> integrations - webhooks" one can get a discord webhooks url for communicating with the text channel. 
  - IMPORTANT webhooks URL should be kept private. Create `discord_webhook_url.env` file, go into the github file .gitignore in base of repository and add the file. One can then add discord webhook link, and github will NOT sync this file. Its only keept on your pc. Share link or file privatly for discord implementation. 
  - Note regarding discord_webhook_url.env: 
    - The file content must follow the format KEY = VALUE. Example: discord_webhook_url = https://discord.com/api/.... The Python script splits the text at the = sign.
- The function is shown below:
	def send_discord_alerts(product_name, quantity):
		discord_url_file = MY_BASE_DIR / "discord_webhook_url.env"

		if not discord_url_file.exists():
			print("Discord webhook URL file not found.")
			return

		with open(discord_url_file, "r") as f:
			file_content = f.read()

			try:
				parts = file_content.split("=")
				discord_url = parts[1].strip()
			
				msg_notification = {"content": f"Remaining number of {product_name} is {quantity}!"}
				requests.post(discord_url, json=msg_notification)
				print("Discord notification sent successfully.")
			except IndexError:
				print("Invalid Discord webhook URL format in the file discord_webhook_url.env")

- The function `send_discord_alerts(product_name, quantity)` is utilized in the `change_stock(item_id,change)`function in `inventory_service.py`
  - when stock of component is decreased and quantity of component goes below 3 a message is sent to the discord text channel
	def change_stock(item_id, change):
		inventory = get_inventory()
		found = False

		for item in inventory:
			if item["id"] == item_id:
				item["quantity"] += change

				if change < 0 and item["quantity"] < 3:
					send_discord_alerts(item["name"], item["quantity"])


				found = True
				break

		if found:
			save_inventory(inventory)
			return True
		else:
			return False
- check
